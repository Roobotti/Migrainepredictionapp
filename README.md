## 🎯 Motivation: Why Migraine Prevention Matters

Migraines represent a critical global health challenge:

- **4th leading cause of disability worldwide**
- **Undertreating leads to silenced suffering** — many sufferers lack proper support and resources
- **Increases suicide risk** — chronic pain conditions significantly impact mental health
- **Spontaneous and common triggers** — making prevention both challenging and essential

**Prevention helps to tackle all of these.** By proactively identifying risk factors and enabling users to modify behaviors, we can reduce migraine frequency and severity, improving quality of life for millions.
